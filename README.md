# Portal RTX Steam Deck mod
Portal RTX on Steam Deck, sounds impossible, but we here at NightSightProductions push the limits of hardware
and we did just that

This mod includes custom graphics presets, FSR 3.1 and more based on testing and what we determined to be the best ways to play on Steam Deck

The presets included are:
Extreme
Ultra
High
Medium
Low

you'll also find a list of instructions and recommended resolutions in the (READ ME.txt) file

Whether you want to play at a high frame rate, high graphics, or high resolution, we got you covered with this mod.
we hope you enjoy what we've done and hope to see you use some of our other projects sometime in the future

Now supporting Linux and Windows

If you need support with anything, we now have a Discord: https://discord.gg/GKacpbpyQb

[Built on SteamOS 3.6]
