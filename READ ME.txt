 Recommended resolutions and fps limits for presets:
  1280x800 or 1600x900 (Recommend FSR Performance with 900p when using Low-Ultra)

  Low: 60 (FSR Ultra Performance)
  Medium: 40 (FSR Performance)
  High: 30 (FSR Quality)
  Ultra: 30 (FSR Quality)
  Extreme: 30 (FSR Performance) [Warning: Extreme is very intensive and may not perform well on Vanilla Steam Deck's]
