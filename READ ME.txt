 Instructions:
  1. Add this launch command to Portal RTX properties: -nogamepadui
  2. Drag and drop one of the rtx.conf presets into Portal RTX directory, make sure to replace existing rtx.conf
  3. Set GPU clock speeds to 1600mhz and use Proton 9 for a smoother experience

  Recommended resolutions and fps limits for presets
  Normal Presets: 1280x800 or 1600x900
  1080p Preset: 1280x800 or 1920x1080


  Performance: 60
  Balanced: 40
  Quality: 30 (If using 1080p, 800p can go up to 40-50fps at 1600mhz, for better life you can uncap the GPU clock speeds and limit fps to 30)

  Warning: While in ALT + X dev menu, do not go to the remix graphics menu, this will revert some changes and reduce performance
